# Lab-3 Due 9/28/21

Workflow Controls

- Create a new branch
- Create code or add files to repository
- Push to the remote repository branch, make sure to title the change and make a summary if needed
- Create a pull request for everyone to view the changes you made
- Once agreed upon merge to the main branch

This is used for a traceable workflow so that we may go back and revert if code is causing issues or not working at all.
